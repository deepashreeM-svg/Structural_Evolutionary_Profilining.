## 🧬 Project Overview
This project investigates the **structural and evolutionary conservation** of selected human **protein–protein interactions (PPIs)** across diverse folds. The study focuses on two representative pairs:  
- **Profilin-1 (PFN1)** with **Beta-actin (ACTB)**  
- **Transthyretin (TTR)** with **Retinol Binding Protein 4 (RBP4)**  

The analysis integrates **sequence-based**, **structure-based**, and **phylogenetic** bioinformatics approaches to uncover conserved residues, interaction interfaces, and evolutionary patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Classify proteins using **SCOPe** and identify interacting partners via **STRING**.  
- Retrieve and annotate 3D structures from **PDB**, **PDBe**, and **PDBsum**.  
- Identify key residues using **PyMOL** visualization.  
- Retrieve homologous sequences using **BLAST** and reduce redundancy using **CD-HIT**.  
- Perform **multiple sequence alignments (MSA)** with Kalign, MAFFT, MUSCLE, Clustal Omega, and T-Coffee.  
- Conduct **structural alignments** with DALI, TM-align, and PROMALS3D.  
- Build **phylogenetic trees** using MEGA and annotate them in **iTOL**.  
- Analyze **mutations** and **disease-associated residues** from **UniProt**.

## 🧫 Methodology
1. **Protein Retrieval and Interaction Mapping:**  
   - Selected PFN1–ACTB and TTR–RBP4 pairs using SCOPe and STRING databases.  
   - Retrieved 3D structures and analyzed interaction sites in PDBe and PDBsum.  

2. **Homology and Clustering:**  
   - Retrieved homologs via BLAST.  
   - Clustered sequences with CD-HIT at 70% identity threshold.

3. **Sequence Alignment and Evaluation:**  
   - Performed MSA using various tools.  
   - Evaluated alignment quality with AliStat — Clustal (MEGA) showed the best completeness scores.

4. **Structure Alignment:**  
   - Conducted pairwise and multiple structure alignments with DALI, TM-align, and PROMALS3D.  

5. **Phylogenetic Analysis:**  
   - Built trees using MEGA (Neighbor-Joining method).  
   - Visualized and annotated with iTOL using custom Python scripts.

6. **Residue and Variant Analysis:**  
   - Mapped functional and disease-related residues via Jalview and UniProt data.

## 🧠 Key Findings
- Profilin-1 interacts with Beta-actin through conserved residues crucial for cytoskeletal organization.  
- Transthyretin binds Retinol Binding Protein 4 for vitamin A transport, highlighting ligand-binding conservation.  
- Multiple sequence and structure alignments reveal fold-level conservation across species.  
- Disease-linked mutations (e.g., in TTR) align with conserved structural regions, indicating functional relevance.
